# Customer Analytics & Experimentation for Retail Optimization

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer transaction data to derive insights, optimize sales strategies, and conduct experimentation using uplift testing. By leveraging statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling, we provide actionable recommendations to improve business performance.

## üöÄ Key Objectives
1. **Data Preparation & Customer Analytics**  
   - Examine transaction data for inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and category identification issues.
   - Clean and preprocess customer data, checking for nulls and merging it with transaction data for analysis.
   - Save cleaned datasets for future use.

2. **Data Analysis & Customer Segmentation**  
   - Define key metrics such as total sales, sales drivers, and high-performing categories.
   - Conduct an in-depth analysis of customer behavior and segmentations.
   - Create charts, graphs, and visualizations to illustrate key trends and insights.
   - Save all analyses and visualizations for reporting.

3. **Experimentation & Uplift Testing**  
   - Identify benchmark stores and define control metrics.
   - Conduct statistical analysis to compare trial and control stores.
   - Use Python/R for data analysis and visualization, summarizing findings and providing recommendations.

4. **Analytics & Commercial Application**  
   - Structure insights into a client-facing report using the Pyramid Principles framework.
   - Define customer segments and develop actionable recommendations.
   - Determine optimal strategies based on packet sizes and purchasing behaviors.
   - Present findings through compelling data-driven storytelling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools
- **Programming Languages:** Python / R
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Experimentation:** A/B Testing, Uplift Modeling
- **Reporting Framework:** Pyramid Principles for structuring client reports

## üìä Approach
1. **Data Examination & Cleaning:** Process transaction and customer datasets to remove anomalies, handle missing values, and ensure consistency.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** Identify behavioral patterns and sales drivers to refine business strategy.
3. **Experimentation Design:** Select control stores based on defined sales metrics.
4. **Statistical Analysis:** Perform uplift testing to determine the impact of store layout changes.
5. **Insights & Recommendations:** Develop structured reports with key findings and data-driven suggestions.

## üéØ Impact
- Improved data quality through rigorous preprocessing and cleaning.
- Identified key customer segments to optimize marketing strategies.
- Quantified the effectiveness of store layout changes through controlled experimentation.
- Provided actionable recommendations to boost sales and enhance customer retention.
